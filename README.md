# Introduction

There is a Data Science Coding Challenge solution in this repository. Below are links to Jupyter notebooks with solutions to all tasks:

üìë [Part 1 - SQL](https://github.com/wojciechkarcz/SQL_Python_coding_challenge/blob/master/part1_sql.ipynb) 

üêç [Part 2 - Python](https://github.com/wojciechkarcz/SQL_Python_coding_challenge/blob/master/part2_python.ipynb)

Each notebook is divided into separate sections for each challenge question.

# Usage

You can download the entire repository with `git clone`:

`git clone https://github.com/wojciechkarcz/SQL_Python_coding_challenge.git`


All the libraries needed for the functions in notebooks to work properly are in the file requirements.txt
You can use `pip` to install them:

`ppip install -r requirements.txt`

The code in the notebooks is compatible with Python 3.8

# Data

All the data needed to run the notebooks is in the `/data` directory. Only those files that are essential for the tasks have been left.
